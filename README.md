# autosplitters
Adding all of my autosplitter work into one repo to clean up github  
if you want to fix any of these ASLs, be my guest - provided you aren't whack about it.

## realMyst: Masterpiece Edition
-Splits on page hand in, as well as automatic load removal  
-TODO: Add alternate splitting methods (book fade)  
-TODO: Find more consistent pointers for splitting, as they work half of the time.  

## Myst: Masterpiece Edition
-Splits for a wide range that Any%/All Pages use.

## Quern
-Removes loading  
-TODO: Add some autosplitting features  

## Obduction
-Removes loading for 1.0, 1.7.0 GOG and Steam, and 1.8.1 Steam  
-TODO: Fix potential autosplit issues (level ID)  
-TODO: Add primative autosplitting capabilities.  
-TODO: Confirm functionality for 1.8.1 GOG.

## The Swapper
-Splits based on time for the initial split.  
-Splits based on save file for the console splits.  
-TODO: Find position pointer for final split and non-time-based initial split  

## INSIDE  
-Splits mostly based on positions dictated with the help of parhelion.  
-Splits based on cycle for the sub and mine splits, as time can only be gained in increments of 6 seconds during that section.  
-TODO: Look into moving the sub split 6 seconds back to line up better with the physical gubbins on the screen.
